This backport is specific to FreeBSD 8.3 from 8-STABLE.

This backported driver can be dropped as soon as we switch to a more 
recent base FreeBSD. See notes above to see which included patch is
present in upon a certain release/branch (as of 2013-09-26):

    MFC 238077:
    Fix panics triggered by older mfiutil binaries run on the new mfi(4) driver.
    The new driver changed the size of the mfi_dcmd_frame structure in such a
    way that a MFI_IOC_PASSTHRU ioctl from an old amd64 binary is treated as an
    MFI_IOC_PASSTHRU32 ioctl in the new driver.  As a result, the user pointer
    is treated as the buffer length.  mfi_user_command() doesn't have a bounds
    check on the buffer length, so it passes a really big value to malloc()
    which panics when it tries to exhaust the kmem_map.  Fix this two ways:
    - Only honor MFI_IOC_PASSTHRU32 if the binary has the SV_ILP32 flag set,
      otherwise treat it as an unknown ioctl.
    - Add a bounds check on the buffer length passed by the user.  For now
      it fails any user attempts to use a buffer larger than 1MB.
    
    While here, fix a few other nits:
    - Remove an unnecessary check for a NULL return from malloc(M_WAITOK).
    - Use the ENOTTY errno for invalid ioctl commands instead of ENOENT.

    When an MFI command fails, the driver needs to set bio->bio_resid so that
    the upper levels notice.  Otherwise we see commands silently failing leading
    to data corruption.  This mirrors dadone()

    Copy code from scsi_read_write() as mfi_build_syspd_cdb() to build SCSI
    command properly.  Without this change, mfi(4) always sends 10 byte READ
    and WRITE commands, which will cause data corruption when device is
    larger than 2^32 sectors.

    MFC r242681 (ambrisko):
    
    - Extend the prior commit to use the generic SCSI command building
      function use that for JBOD and Thunderbolt disk write command.  Now
      we only have one implementation in mfi.
    - Fix dumping on Thunderbolt cards.  Polled IO commands do not seem to
      be normally acknowledged by changing cmd_status to MFI_STAT_OK.
      In order to get acknowledgement of the IO is complete, the Thunderbolt
      command queue needs to be run through.  I added a flag MFI_CMD_SCSI
      to indicate this command is being polled and to complete the
      Thunderbolt wrapper and indicate the result.  This flag needs to be
      set in the JBOD case in case if that us using Thunderbolt card.
      When in the polling loop check for completed commands.
    - Remove mfi_tbolt_is_ldio and just do the check when needed.
    - Fix an issue when attaching of disk device happens when a device is
      already scheduled to be attached but hasn't attached.
    - add a tunable to allow raw disk attachment to CAM via:
            hw.mfi.allow_cam_disk_passthrough=1
    - fixup aborting of commands (AEN and LD state change).  Use a generic
      abort function and only wait the command being aborted not both.
      Thunderbolt cards don't seem to abort commands so the abort times
      out.

    MFC r252471:
    Remove forced timeout of in-flight commands from mfi_timeout.

    While this prevents commands getting stuck forever there is no way to guarantee
    that data from the command hasn't been committed to the device.

    In addition older mfi firmware has a bug that would cause the controller to
    frequently stall IO for over our timeout value, which when combined with
    a forced timeout often resulted in panics in UFS; which would otherwise be
    avoided when the command eventually completed if left alone.

    For reference this timeout issue is resolved in Dell FW package 21.2.1-0000.
    Fixed FW package version for none Dell controller will likely vary.
